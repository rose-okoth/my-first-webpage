        <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>

        <p>When it comes to things, there are quite a few that I like.</p> 
        <p>These are just a few of them.</p>

        <h2><em>Friends</em></h2>

        <p>Friends are an <strong>important</strong> part of anyone's life. They help cheer you on when you need it, they lift you up when you're feeling down, they help you celebrate in the good times and the bad, and keep you from getting lonely.</p>
        <p>It's more important though, to have a small circle of people that you trust than a bigger one filled with random, name-only, friends.</p>
        <p>My close circle only has four people in it. They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anne.</li>
            <li>Prudence.</li>
            <li>Tuphy.</li>
            <li>And Mary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><em>Food</em></h2>

        <p>Apart from my friends, food is another one of my favorites, if not the my <mark>ulmitate</mark> favorite. My top three in the food area would be:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chicken.</li>
            <li>Cheesecake, because desserts are a given.</li>
            <li>And last but not least, pasta. Pasta, pasta and everything pasta.</li>
        </ol>
